# Student-Management-System
The School Management System is a Python-based command-line application that uses a MySQL database to efficiently manage student and teacher records. The system is designed to simulate basic administrative operations performed in a school environment, such as adding, removing, updating, and retrieving data.

The application establishes a connection with the MySQL database using the MySQL connector, enabling seamless interaction between Python and the database. It supports structured data storage for students and teachers, ensuring organized and persistent record management.

A secure login system is implemented to restrict access, allowing only authorized users to interact with the system. Once logged in, users are presented with a menu-driven interface that provides various functionalities, including adding new students and teachers, deleting records, viewing lists, and searching for specific entries.

The system also includes conditional logic for handling student streams for higher grades (11 and 12), demonstrating real-world data handling scenarios. Additionally, it allows updating student information, such as modifying their stream, making the system dynamic and interactive.

This project highlights the integration of database management with Python programming and demonstrates key concepts such as SQL queries, data manipulation, user authentication, and modular programming. It serves as a practical example of building a real-world application using backend technologies.
